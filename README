VectorTileMap is a vector-tile map viewer currently developed at University of Bremen. 
This application is based on mapsforge and extends it with an OpenGL renderer to enable 
continuous scaling of the map view (http://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/). An additional 
PostGIS backend is also under develpment which is intended to ease creation and 
compilation of multi-resolution maps from different data sources. 

precompiled binaries and maps are at http://code.google.com/p/vector-tile-map/downloads
